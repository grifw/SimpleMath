This is a website that will generate simple math problems. There are two buttons: one creates a random division problem that will always result as an interger between 1 and 10 the other creates a random multiplication problem with both mutiples being an interger between 1 and 10. The website will ask the problem it generates and take a user input it lets the user know if they got the problem correct or not. the website also keeps track of the number of questions you get right and wrong.
